Welcome to Yunfei's homepage.

I’m currently working for my Ph.D degree in [Maizie Zhou’s lab](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/maizie-zhou-lab/). 

My reseaching endeavour is to understand how to tackle a range of machine learning problems, including designing new algorithms for high-throughput sequencing data, medical images, etc. 
Collaborating with other lab members, we investigate a wide range of questions, including but not limiting to computational genomics, bioinformatics, computational neuroscience, and machine learning.
