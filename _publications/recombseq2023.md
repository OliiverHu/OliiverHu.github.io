title: "ADEPT: Autoencoder with Differentially Expressed Genes and Imputation for a Robust Spatial Transcriptomics Clustering"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/recombseq2023
excerpt: 'To harness both spatial context and transcriptional profile in ST data, we develop a novel graph-based multi-stage framework for robust clustering, called ADEPT. To control and stabilize data quality, ADEPT relies on selection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and imputation of the multiple DEG-based matrices for the initial and final clustering of a graph autoencoder backbone that minimizes the variance of clustering results.'
