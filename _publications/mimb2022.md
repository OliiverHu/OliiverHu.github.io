Motivated by current limitations in generating high-quality diploid assemblies and detecting variants, a new suite of software tools, Aquila, was developed to fully take advantage of linked-read sequencing technology. The overarching goal of Aquila is to exploit the strengths of linked-read technology including long-range connectivity and inherent phasing of variants for reference-assisted local de novo assembly at the whole-genome scale.
