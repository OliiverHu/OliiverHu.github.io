After extending the algorithm to shortreads dataset, we tested the performance of AquilaDeepFilter on all five linked-reads and short-read libraries sequenced from the well-studied NA24385 sample, validated against the Genome in a Bottle benchmark. To demonstrate the filtering ability of AquilaDeepFilter, we utilized the SV calls from three upstream SV detection tools including Aquila, Aquila_stLFR and Delly as the baseline.
